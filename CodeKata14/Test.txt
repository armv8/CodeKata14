We telegraphed for them, and they came, hundreds, thousands, one might
almost say millions of them. Some few were large as a half-sheet of
notepaper; more, scarce big enough to hold a letter of the alphabet.
The paper was of all shades, sorts, and sizes: butchers’ bags pressed
and sliced in two, wrapping-paper, the backs of envelopes--anything
and everything that could hold writing. The early years of the diary
are printed in letters so close that, when the sheets are fitted, not
another letter can be squeezed in. In later passages the characters
are written with childish clumsiness, and later still one sees the
gradually forming adult hand.

The labor of piecing the diary together may fairly be described
as enormous. For nine months almost continuously the diarist has
labored, piecing it together sheet by sheet, each page a kind of
picture-puzzle, lettered, for frugality (the store was precious),
on both sides of the paper.

The entire diary, of which this volume covers but the two opening
years, must comprise a total of a quarter of a million words. Upwards
of seventy thousand--all that is contained in this volume--can
be ascribed with more than reasonable definiteness to the end of
Opal’s sixth and to her seventh year. During all these months Opal
Whiteley has been a frequent visitor in the _Atlantic_’s office. With
friendliness came confidence, and little by little, very gradually,
an incident here, another there, her story came to be told. She
was at first eager only for the future and for the opportunity to
write and teach children of the world which she loved best. But as
the thread of the diary was unraveled, she felt a growing interest
in what her past had been, and in what lay behind her earliest
recollections and the opening chapters of her printed record.

Her methods were nothing if not methodical. First, the framework
of a sheet would be fitted and the outer edges squared. Here the
adornment of borders in childish patterns, and the fortunate fact
that the writer had employed a variety of colored crayons, using
each color until it was exhausted, lent an unhoped-for aid. Then,
odd sheets were fitted together; later, fragments of episodes.
Whenever one was completed, it was typed by an assistant on a card,
and in this way there came into being a card-system that would do
credit to a scientific museum of modest proportions. Finally the
cards were filed in sequence, the manuscript then typed off and
printed just as at first written, with no change whatever other than
omissions, the adoption of reasonable rules of capitalization (the
manuscript for many years has nothing but capitals), and the addition
of punctuation, of which the manuscript is entirely innocent. The
spelling--with the exception of occasional characteristic examples
of the diarist’s individual style--has, in the reader’s interest,
been widely amended.
